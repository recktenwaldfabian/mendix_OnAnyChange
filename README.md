# Trigger Event on any attribute change

This widget will listen to all changes of attributes in the context entity and trigger a microflow or nanoflow on a change.

 Usefull if you want to check if a user has entered any
 data on a page.

# Introducing OnSpecificChange

This new widget is still configurable to to listen for any changes, but now includes extra options. It is now possible to select a single attribute or a list of specific attributes to listen to for changes!

NOTE: If using 'Single' as the Listener Type, the widget will default back to 'Any' during runtime if you do not select a specific attribute.

NOTE: If using 'List' as the Listener Type, the widget will default back to 'Any' during runtime if you have not selected at least one attribute.
